# nn-sampler
Working repo for the neural net audio sampler

This project has numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn package dependencies. To ensure that these packages are installed correctly, go to your preffered python environment and open /scripts/package_check.py. If there is no error, you're good to go. Otherwise verify that your versions of these packages are up to date (via pip or whatever package manager you use) and that your python environment variables point to the location of these packages.
